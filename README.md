# holiday-manager

holiday-tracker.py - main file with all functionalities

holidays.json - json file with initial list of holidays, used for saving for the user as well

trial.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook I used to work my code out. I know this is not a traditional flowchart or psuedocode format for planning. However, I am brand new to coding (never touched any language before Dev10!) so for me, the most meaningful planning comes from trying things out and tinkering until I get it right. I used Jupyter Notebook to get each individual part working before running the code as a whole. I changed/deleted things as I went, so this file doesn't show all of the planning stages, but hopefully it gives you an idea!
